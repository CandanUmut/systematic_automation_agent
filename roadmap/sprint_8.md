**Bismillahirrahmanirrahim.**
The system is now complete in concept — and **the age of Command-Driven Autonomy begins.** 🌍🤖💡

## 🔒 Finalized Roadmap

**“The Commander Agent + Dynamic Operator System”**

We now operate on **two fronts**, synced and expandable:

---

### 🧭 PHASE 1 — Action Recorder Engine (Agent-Side)

> “Record every human interaction and convert it into reusable workflow data.”

* [ ] `StartRecording()` & `StopRecording()` — CLI or GUI button
* [ ] Capture:

  * 🖱 Mouse clicks & coordinates
  * ⌨️ Keystrokes & input text
  * 📂 Opened file/folder paths
  * ⚙️ Executed apps or scripts
  * 🧾 Shell/Python commands
  * 🖼 Optional screenshot log per step
* [ ] Export as `workflow.json` with `steps`, `actions`, `metadata`, and 🔑 **variable placeholders**

---

### 🧭 PHASE 2 — Universal Executor Engine (Agent-Side)

> “Replay what was recorded, infinitely, intelligently.”

* [ ] Parse and run workflows from JSON/Python
* [ ] Step engine with delay, retry, and loops
* [ ] Smart variable injection:

  * `${filename}`, `${search_term}`, `${user_input}`, etc.
  * 💡 **Prompt user at runtime if variable is unset**
* [ ] CLI or GUI command: `run_workflow('youtube_shorts')`
* [ ] Full logs + error handling

---

### 🧭 PHASE 3 — Operator Input Bridge (Web-Side)

> “Let the web interface send and receive dynamic parameters.”

* [ ] Support `dynamic_fields` in templates:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Create YouTube Short about ${topic}",
    "path": "/projects/youtube/${topic}/edit.mp4"
  }
  ```
* [ ] Show interactive inputs in web UI for any `${var}`
* [ ] Agent receives:

  ```json
  {
    "template_id": "short_maker",
    "vars": { "topic": "Mushroom AI", "language": "en" }
  }
  ```
* [ ] Agent replaces variables and executes

---

### 🧭 PHASE 4 — Schedule, Loop, Chain

> “Let agent automate this infinitely.”

* [ ] Agent cron scheduling for workflows
* [ ] Looping a workflow until done
* [ ] Chain multiple workflows with `after` condition
* [ ] Daily/weekly planner integration

---

### 🧭 PHASE 5 — Workflow Studio (Optional UI Tool)

> “Edit and build workflows manually or visually.”

* [ ] Drag-and-drop task editor
* [ ] Variable preview & test runner
* [ ] Import/export workflows
* [ ] Timeline/flowchart view

---

## ✨ Example Workflow (`workflow.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "daily_youtube",
  "steps": [
    { "type": "open", "path": "C:/Projects/Youtube" },
    { "type": "click", "x": 421, "y": 218 },
    { "type": "type", "text": "${topic}" },
    { "type": "run", "command": "python gen.py ${topic}" },
    { "type": "wait", "seconds": 3 },
    { "type": "screenshot", "filename": "preview.png" }
  ],
  "vars": ["topic"]
}
```

## ⚡ FINAL LOCK-IN: Two Sides in Sync

| Feature             | Agent-Side                     | Operator-Side               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Task Recorder       | ✅ `agent_workflow_recorder.py` | ❌ (not needed)              |
| Executor/Runner     | ✅ CLI / daemon                 | 🟡 Sends commands/templates |
| Dynamic Variables   | ✅ Inject + prompt if missing   | ✅ Web form inputs           |
| Schedule Support    | ✅ Cron, loop, retry            | 🟡 Schedule form            |
| Template Management | 🟡 Pulls templates             | ✅ Hosts & edits them        |
| Logs & Status       | ✅ Stores locally / sends back  | ✅ Shows run logs            |

---

## 🏁 STARTING SPRINT PLAN

1. 🔧 Build the Recorder: `agent_workflow_recorder.py`
2. 🧪 Add minimal steps (click, type, open file)
3. 🧠 Create `workflow_runner.py` with `${var}` support
4. 🌐 On Operator, allow sending templates + `vars`
5. 🧬 Test first dynamic workflow: “Make a YouTube Short about \${topic}”

**Bismillah. This is the moment. Let’s make the first recording engine.**
